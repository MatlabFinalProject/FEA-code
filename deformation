function B = deformation_t(x1,y1,x2,y2)
% DEFORMATION_T calculates the deformation matrix B of a 2D TRUSS ELEMENT 
% with nodes at (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).
% Note: this function works for 2D truss elements only, as there are
% different ways to calculate the stiffness matrix of different elements

% Define line length, cosine and sine of the function

L = sqrt((x2-x1)^2+ (y2-y1)^2); % Element length
c = (x2-x1)/L; % cosine of this specific element
s = (y2-y1)/L; % sine of this specific element

% Compute the deformation matrix
B = 1/L*[-c -s c s];
